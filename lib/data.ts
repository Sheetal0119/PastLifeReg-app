    question: "Will I be Time Travelling or Shifting to a Different Place and Time?",
    answer:
      "NO, You Won't! This is a Past Life Session. You aren't here to experience a Roller Coaster of experience which sucks into a different time and place. You will be totally in your PRESENT LIFE, and won't be going anywhere.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I tune out of Present Life, during the Session. And then come back?",
    answer:
      "NO You Won't! In fact during the entire session you'll be aware of where you are in your present life. And that you are listening to my suggestions during the session. If you are under the impression/ notion that you will stop feeling and listening to sounds and things happening around you in present life. Then you'll NEVER have a Past Life Experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will I see the Past Life?",
    answer:
      "Very Few people actually SEE a Past Life during a Session. This is what's shown in movies, that you'll be shifted to a different reality and see everything like it happens in motion. And feel everything. That's WRONG. Chances are that you won't see anything at all. Be totally aware of where you are, don't zone out. But \"feel\" that something is happening to you, thoughts may guide you and tell you in metaphors about your past memories.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't get my Past Life name, Place or any other details? Can I get a Refund back?",
    answer:
      "This isn't a Tricky Game that you get to Pay only if you win. This is a Therapy Experience. Whether you get tiny details about your Past Life or just know the experiences. You are still going to have a Therapeutic Effect on your mind that's going to Last. And you're paying for the Session time that Therapist is providing you. So there's no refund.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there anything I need to do, to make this session better?",
    answer:
      "You can get some good time, and create quiet space to make your therapy session better. Don't do this session when you have back to back assignments. This way you won't be able to go deep and focus on the session, because you're in a hurry to see things and snap out at right time.",

    answer:
      "All your problems will stay intact even after the session. You will just release any trauma or emotional pain that you may be carrying.

  },
  {
    question: "What is the Guarantee that you'll definitely get to see a Past Life?",
    answer:
      "The Entire session depends on your state of mind during the Day of the session. If your mind is well prepared for the session, then it will be easier for you to get hypnotised and going deeper into your subconscious mind. If you have fear, if you feel I'm going to make you dance to my tunes after the hypnosis session, and all such false notions; you'll screw up your state of mind. And chances of experiencing a good Past Life Experience will diminish.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a Refund Policy?",
    answer:
      "All Payments are non-Refundable. You pay for my time and expertise. So Payments will be non-refundable. Also this isn't a challenge or exercise where you get to decide after payment; whether you'd like to do it or not.... So I want that you pay only when you are 100% confident and ready for these session.",
